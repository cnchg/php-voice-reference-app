Bandwidth SIP Call registration
=======================================================================

This application implements the guide here:
http://ap.bandwidth.com/docs/how-to-guides/use-endpoints-make-receive-calls-sip-clients/
(using PHP catapult)


What you will need:

1. A Bandwidth Catapult account
2. SIP domains enabled on your account

Steps:

This application on success will create a user, domain and endpoint. Afterwards
listen to incoming and outgoing calls, using AnswerCallEvent and IncomingCallEvent,
when the calls are both found it will bridge into one call

Instructions / Howto:

Setting It Up:

To set the SIP call processor up, you will need to:

git clone  https://github.com/BandwidthExamples/php-voice-reference-app.git

update credentials.json with your own

check its running properly via:

php ./start.php

if all is well you should get:

"Thanks you can use the SIP Call Processing application"



More:
----------------------------------------------------------------

this application is made for single term use and will act on behalf of end users,
as a result you can call it multiple times with different credentials each
having its own domain and endpoint outputted. Your endpoint will need an application
id as this will bind all the Catapult events to it, for best use case
it is good to make a seperate application just for this program


Examples (using curl):

incoming

curl -H 'username: my_username' -H 'password: my_password'  php-bandwidth-applications/incoming/

response:




outgoing
curl -H 'username: my_username' -H 'password: my_password' php-bandwidth-applications/outgoing/

Both of these will create a new endpoint when one does not exist and listen for
incoming, answer call events on these URLS
